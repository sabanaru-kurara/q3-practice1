				<p class="text-primary">PATIENCE</p>
				<p class="text-white">Patience is the ability to wait for things without whining or complaining. Many desire to have patience, which is only attained by going through trials, and learning through experience that all things work together for good because God is always faithful. We should always be as patient with others as we would like them to be with us. How patient are you? </p>
